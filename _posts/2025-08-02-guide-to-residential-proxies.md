### **What Are Residential Proxies?**

Simply put, a residential proxy is an intermediary server that routes your internet connection through an IP address provided by a real Internet Service Provider (ISP). This makes your request look like it's coming from a genuine home user on a desktop or mobile device, not from a server in a data center.

This legitimacy is key. Websites are much less likely to block or serve misleading information to a residential IP address, making them the gold standard for reliable data collection and web access.

### **What Can You Do with Them?**

While the applications are vast, here are a few common use cases:

* **Market Research:** Businesses can view competitor websites from different countries to check prices, product availability, and marketing campaigns as a local user would see them.
* **Ad Verification:** Marketers can use residential IPs to check that their digital ads are being displayed correctly in different regions and to the right audiences, free from fraud.
* **Brand Protection:** Companies can scan the web for unauthorized use of their logos or copyrighted material without revealing their own identity.
* **Accessing Geo-Restricted Content:** Unblock streaming services, news sites, and social media platforms that are restricted in your current location.

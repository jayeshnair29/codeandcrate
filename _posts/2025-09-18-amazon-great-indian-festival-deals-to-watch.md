The best time of the year for deal hunters is almost here: the Amazon Great Indian Festival! As a tech tinkerer, this is when I get serious about my wishlist. Instead of getting lost in the thousands of deals, I focus on a few key items that offer massive value.

This isn't just a list of random products; these are the deals I'm personally watching and adding to my cart so I get notified the second the price drops. Here’s what’s on my radar.

### **1. Realme Buds Air 7 Pro**

  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 200px; margin-right: 1.5rem;">
    Realme has been killing it in the audio space, and the Air 7 Pro are their premium contenders. They're currently listed at Rs 5,499 (down from an original price of Rs 7,999), but Amazon is teasing <strong>discounts of up to 60%</strong> on earbuds. If this is true, these could drop to an unbelievable price. For high-quality sound and features, this is the one to watch.

  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 200px; margin-right: 1.5rem;">
    If you're looking for the absolute best value, this is it. The OnePlus Nord series is known for delivering premium features at a budget price, and the Nord Buds 3 Pro are no exception. The sale price is expected to be <strong>Rs 2,999</strong>, which is a steal for earbuds with this level of quality and performance. This is an instant buy for me if it hits that price.

### **3. Samsung S24 Ultra (Flagship Power, Unbelievable Price)**

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 200px; margin-right: 1.5rem;">
    This one is a showstopper. It's rare to see a current-gen flagship phone like the S24 Ultra get a massive price cut, but the sale price is teased to be <strong>Rs 71,999</strong>. For anyone who has been waiting to upgrade to a true top-of-the-line phone, this might be the best opportunity of the year. The camera and performance on this device are second to none.

  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 200px; margin-right: 1.5rem;">
    With the festive season right around the corner, this is the perfect time to think about gifts. This Fossil watch is elegant, timeless, and with a sale price of <strong>Rs 8,307</strong>, it’s an affordable piece of luxury. It's a fantastic gifting option for Diwali or a birthday, and a great deal to snag during the sale.

### **5. The 55-inch TV Steal**

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 200px; margin-right: 1.5rem;">
    Thanks to GST benefits and festival offers, this is the year to upgrade your home entertainment setup. You can expect to see 55-inch 4K Smart TVs from major brands going for as low as <strong>Rs 22,000</strong>. That's an incredible price for a huge screen, perfect for movie nights and cricket season. This is less a specific product and more a category to watch like a hawk.
